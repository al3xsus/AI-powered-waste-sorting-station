## **Step-by-Step Process for Sorting Metals Using Available Sensors**

---

### **Step 1: Initial Identification (Image Recognition)**

1. **Image recognition** identifies the item as **metal** based on its shape and common metal objects (e.g., aluminum cans, steel pans, metal tools).
   - The system can recognize basic forms of metal waste, like **cans**, **foil**, and **metal scraps**.

2. **Display prompts the user** if any non-metal components need to be removed (e.g., plastic handles or rubber parts attached to metal items).

### **Step 2: Magnetic Sensor to Detect Ferrous Metals**

1. The system uses a **magnetic sensor** to test whether the metal item is **ferrous** or **non-ferrous**.
   - **Ferrous metals** (containing iron) like **steel** and **cast iron** are magnetic and will be detected by the magnetic sensor.
   - **Non-ferrous metals** (like aluminum, copper, brass) are non-magnetic and will not be affected by the magnet.

2. **System Feedback**:
   - If the item is magnetic (ferrous metal), the system directs the user to place it in the **"Ferrous Metals" bin**.
   - If the item is non-magnetic, the system proceeds to the next step to further distinguish **non-ferrous metals**.

### **Step 3: Weight Sensor (Optional)**

1. **Weight sensors** (salvaged from digital scales) can be used to further **distinguish metal types** based on their weight.
   - For example, **aluminum** is lighter than **steel** or **copper**, so a weight reading can help verify the type of metal.
   
2. **System Feedback**:
   - After the item is placed on the weight sensor, the system can cross-check the material type (detected by the magnetic or inductive sensors) with the weight to confirm whether the item should be sorted as **lightweight aluminum** or **heavier metals** like copper or steel.
   - If the item is lightweight (like aluminum), the system prompts the user to place it in the **Aluminum bin**.

### **Step 4: Final Sorting**

Once the system has confirmed the type of metal using the magnetic, inductive, and weight sensors, it directs the user to place the item in the **appropriate metal bin**:
   - **Ferrous Metals**: Steel, iron, cast iron (magnetic metals).
   - **Non-Ferrous Metals**:
     - **Aluminum**: Cans, foil, lightweight metal items.
     - **Copper, Brass**: Heavier, non-magnetic metals.
     - **Other Non-Ferrous Metals**: This could include items like **zinc**, **titanium**, etc.
