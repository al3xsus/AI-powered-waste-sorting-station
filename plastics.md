## **Step-by-Step Process for Sorting Plastics Using Available Sensors**

---

### **Step 1: Initial Identification (Image Recognition)**

1. **Image recognition** identifies the item based on its **shape and common plastic objects** (e.g., packaging, plastic container).
   - The system can recognize typical plastic items like **food containers**, and **plastic packaging**.
   
2. **System prompts the user** to remove any non-plastic components if needed (e.g., metal caps, labels, or attached non-recyclable parts).

### **Step 2: Detect Plastic Type Using Optical and Image Recognition**

1. **Optical sensors** and **cameras** equipped with AI-based pattern recognition can analyze the item's **surface characteristics**, color, and possibly the **recycling symbol** or **plastic resin code** (1 through 7).
   - **Plastic Resin Codes**:
     - **1 (PET)**: Polyethylene Terephthalate – common in beverage bottles and packaging.
     - **2 (HDPE)**: High-Density Polyethylene – used for milk jugs, detergent bottles, etc.
     - **3 (PVC)**: Polyvinyl Chloride – found in pipes and some packaging.
     - **4 (LDPE)**: Low-Density Polyethylene – used in plastic bags, some packaging.
     - **5 (PP)**: Polypropylene – used for food containers, bottle caps.
     - **6 (PS)**: Polystyrene – used in foam cups, disposable cutlery.
     - **7 (Other)**: Various plastics, including bioplastics.

2. **System Feedback**:
   - Based on the **resin code** or visual properties, the system provides feedback:
     - **If the code or type is recognized**: The system instructs the user on which specific **plastic bin** to place the item (e.g., "Place this PET bottle in the Plastics Type 1 bin").
     - **If unrecognized or damaged symbol**: The system may prompt the user to manually check and confirm the recycling symbol before proceeding.

### **Step 3: Sorting Plastics by Weight (Optional)**

- **Weight sensor** can be used to **verify the type of plastic** based on the item’s weight:
  - Lighter plastics like **LDPE (4)** and **PS (6)** would weigh less compared to heavier plastics like **HDPE (2)** or **PET (1)**.
  - **System Feedback**: If the item weighs more or less than expected for its type, the system might prompt the user to check the recycling symbol or place it in a separate bin for manual review.

---

### **Step 4: Sorting by Color (Optional)**

- **Optical sensors** can also detect the **color** of plastics, which is particularly important for recycling facilities that may separate plastic by color.
  - **Clear plastics** (e.g., PET bottles) are more valuable in recycling than colored plastics, so the system can identify if a bottle is clear, green, or brown.
  - **System Feedback**: The system may guide the user to sort clear plastic separately from colored plastics if the recycling stream demands it (e.g., "Place clear plastics in the designated bin").

### **Step 5: Final Sorting**

Once the **plastic type and color** have been identified:
   - The system directs the user to place the plastic item into the **appropriate bin** based on the identified plastic type and characteristics.
   - **Plastic types (bins)** could include categories like:
     - PET (Plastic #1)
     - HDPE (Plastic #2)
     - Other Plastics (#3-7).
