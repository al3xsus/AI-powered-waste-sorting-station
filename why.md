# Why?
In developed countries, a **significant amount of waste** that is **recyclable** still ends up in **landfills** due to various factors such as improper sorting, lack of access to recycling facilities, or contamination of recyclables. Here's a breakdown of the key statistics and insights:

### **Key Statistics on Recyclable Waste in Landfills**:

1. **United States**:
   - According to the **U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)**, of the approximately **292 million tons of municipal solid waste** (MSW) generated in 2018, **69 million tons (24%)** were recycled and **25 million tons (9%)** were composted.
   - However, **50%** (about **146 million tons**) of the waste was **landfilled**, and a significant portion of this could have been recycled or composted. Estimates suggest that up to **75%** of landfill waste is **recyclable**.

2. **European Union**:
   - In the **European Union**, about **60%** of municipal waste could be recycled or composted, but many countries still send a large portion to landfills or incineration. In 2020, the recycling rate for municipal waste across the EU was **48%**.
   - Some studies suggest that between **30-50%** of waste that ends up in landfills could have been recycled.

3. **United Kingdom**:
   - In the **UK**, it is estimated that about **20% of the waste sent to landfills** could be **recycled** but isnâ€™t due to poor sorting or contamination.
   - In 2018, the UK's recycling rate was **45%**, meaning a large portion of potentially recyclable material was still landfilled.

4. **Canada**:
   - In **Canada**, approximately **10.5 million tons of waste** are sent to landfills annually, and about **40%** of that is considered **recyclable** (including paper, plastics, and metals).
   - Only about **9% of plastics** are recycled in Canada, meaning that **91%** of plastic waste ends up in landfills or incinerated, despite a significant portion being recyclable.

### **Types of Recyclable Waste Commonly Sent to Landfills**:
- **Plastics**: Plastics are one of the most commonly landfilled materials, even though much of it is technically recyclable. However, contamination, improper sorting, or lack of facilities often prevent recycling. Globally, only about **9% of plastic waste** is recycled.
  
- **Paper and Cardboard**: Around **68%** of paper and cardboard is recycled in developed countries like the U.S., but a significant portion still ends up in landfills due to contamination (e.g., food-soiled paper) or improper disposal.
  
- **Glass**: In many developed countries, only **33-40%** of glass is recycled, with the remainder being landfilled, despite it being 100% recyclable.
  
- **Metals**: While metals like aluminum and steel are highly recyclable, many still end up in landfills, especially when mixed with other waste streams. The **recycling rate for aluminum cans** is around **50%** in the U.S., meaning the other half ends up in landfills.

- **Textiles**: Around **85% of textile waste** in developed countries is landfilled or incinerated, even though much of it could be reused or recycled.

### **Why Recyclable Waste Ends Up in Landfills**:
1. **Contamination**: Even if materials are technically recyclable, they may be contaminated with food, liquids, or non-recyclable materials, rendering them unrecyclable.
   
2. **Lack of Proper Sorting**: Households and businesses often fail to properly sort recyclables from general waste, leading to recyclable items being sent to landfills.

3. **Insufficient Recycling Infrastructure**: In some areas, recycling facilities may not exist or be easily accessible, leading to more waste being sent to landfills.

4. **Economic Factors**: In some cases, recycling certain materials may not be economically viable due to market conditions, leading to those materials being disposed of in landfills instead.

5. **Consumer Behavior**: Lack of awareness or motivation to recycle properly also contributes to recyclable materials ending up in landfills.

### **Ergo**:
In developed countries, a **large portion of landfill waste** is **recyclable**, with estimates ranging from **30% to 75%** depending on the region and material type. The key reasons for this waste ending up in landfills are contamination, improper sorting, lack of recycling infrastructure, and consumer behavior. Addressing these challenges could significantly reduce the amount of recyclable waste that ends up in landfills.
