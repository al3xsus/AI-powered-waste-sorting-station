## **Step-by-Step Process for Sorting Paper and Cardboard Using Available Sensors**

---

### **Step 1: Initial Identification (Image Recognition)**

1. **Image recognition** identifies the item as **paper or cardboard** based on its shape, size, and texture.
   - The system distinguishes between **paper products** (e.g., regular paper, magazines, newspapers) and **cardboard** based on thickness, structure, and visual patterns.

2. **System Feedback**:
   - The system might prompt the user to flatten cardboard boxes or remove any attached materials (e.g., plastic tapes or labels) if detected by the camera.

### **Step 2: Paper vs. Cardboard Sorting**

1. **Image recognition** further differentiates between **paper** and **cardboard**:
   - **Paper**: Includes office paper, newspapers, magazines, flyers, and shredded paper.
   - **Cardboard**: Includes thicker corrugated cardboard boxes, cereal boxes, and packaging materials.

2. **System Feedback**:
   - **Paper**: The system prompts the user to place regular paper items (e.g., newspapers, office paper) in the **"Paper" bin**.
   - **Cardboard**: The system directs the user to place thicker cardboard items in the **"Cardboard" bin**.

### **Step 3: Weight Check (Optional)**

- **Weight sensors** (salvaged from digital scales) can be used to assess whether the item is **thin paper** or **thicker cardboard**.
   - **Paper** tends to be lighter, while **cardboard** is heavier and bulkier.
   - This helps further verify the distinction between **lightweight paper** and **heavier cardboard**.

2. **System Feedback**:
   - If the item is lightweight, the system confirms it as **paper** and directs the user to the corresponding bin.
   - If the item is heavier, the system confirms it as **cardboard** and prompts the user to place it in the **Cardboard bin**.

### **Step 4: Final Sorting**

Once the system has determined whether the item is **paper or cardboard**, **clean or contaminated**, and possibly **sorted by paper type**, the user is directed to place it in the correct bin:
   - **Paper**: Office paper, newspapers, magazines.
   - **Cardboard**: Corrugated boxes, packaging, thick paperboard.
